Objective:
Design a complete end-to-end AI-powered data pipeline to collect, process, analyze, and visualize real-time social media comments related to a specific keyword or person‚Äôs name (e.g., "‡∞é‡∞Æ‡±ç‡∞Æ‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±ç‡∞Ø‡±á ‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞ï‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞≤ ‡∞∏‡±Å‡∞∞‡±á‡∞∑‡±ç ‡∞ó‡∞æ‡∞∞‡±Å"), across platforms like YouTube, Twitter (X), Instagram, and Facebook.

üìå Prompt Content:
I want to build a real-time AI application that collects comments and feedback related to a person or keyword across YouTube, Twitter (X), Instagram, and Facebook.

For example, I want to analyze public sentiment and feedback for the Telugu politician "‡∞é‡∞Æ‡±ç‡∞Æ‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±ç‡∞Ø‡±á ‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞ï‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞≤ ‡∞∏‡±Å‡∞∞‡±á‡∞∑‡±ç ‡∞ó‡∞æ‡∞∞‡±Å". The system should:

üéØ Functional Requirements:
Accept input as a person‚Äôs name or keyword (supports English and Telugu).

Generate possible variations (transliterations and keyword combos).

Use respective platform APIs (YouTube Data API, X API, Meta Graph API) to fetch:

Recent public comments, posts, replies.

Top-liked or top-replied content.

Perform data cleaning, language detection, and translation (Telugu ‚Üí English if required).

Run sentiment analysis and topic extraction using pre-trained LLM/NLP models.

Store results in a structured database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL).

Provide REST APIs to expose analytics to a frontend.

Frontend dashboard should display:

Top keywords

Sentiment trends over time

Influential commenters

Sample positive/negative/neutral comments

üîß Technical Expectations:
Use Spring Boot or Node.js for backend.

Use Kafka or RabbitMQ if needed for streaming/decoupling.

Use YouTube Data API, X API (v2), Meta Graph API.

Integrate language detection, translation, and sentiment models (like VADER, TextBlob, or Hugging Face models for Telugu/English).

Store all raw + processed data in MongoDB/PostgreSQL.

Build analytics REST endpoints.

Visualize results using React (or Angular), with charts and filters.

üß† Bonus (Optional AI Upgrades):
Summarize feedback with LLM.

Show AI-generated feedback summary like:
‚ÄúMost users are happy with recent initiatives by Kakarl Suresh garu, especially in irrigation and roads.‚Äù

Implement time-based filtering (e.g., feedback over past 7 days vs 30 days).

Alert system if negative sentiment spikes.

üì¶ Deployment:
Should support containerization (Docker).

Use Kubernetes or similar for scaling.

Secure all external API tokens and endpoints.

üß© Output You Expect:
Ask for:

Component-wise pipeline design.

Sequence flow from input to visualization.

Tech stack suggestions.

Microservices split if applicable.

Sample database schema (e.g., comments, sentiments, queries).

Diagrams (e.g., Mermaid or PlantUML syntax for architecture).

CI/CD and cloud deployment options (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
